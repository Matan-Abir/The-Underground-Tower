# The-Underground-Tower
This is my finals project from practical engineering school. It was written in C# in WPF, and is a roguelike-type game. It is relatively underdeveloped in terms of game design, but the idea was to make a proof of concept. I probably should've picked a better engine as WPF is not exactly meant for games, but it was certainly entertaining to make, especially the visuals where several images can be stacked on top of each other (player standing on a tile that has an object on it and all three are visible at once, for example.) Enemy navigation uses A* algorithm which is a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm common in game design. Once the player is in view of an enemy, said enemy will find the shortest path possible towards the player and advance towards him. Naturally, the monster cannot go through walls, which changes the pathing.
